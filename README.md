## 🚗 Fuel Consumption Prediction Model  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to **predict CO2 emissions** based on various fuel consumption factors using a **Multiple Linear Regression** model. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides fuel consumption data for different vehicles, enabling a data-driven approach to emissions forecasting.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **CO2 Emissions Prediction** – Accurately estimates CO2 output based on vehicle parameters.  
✅ **Regression Analysis** – Uses **Multiple Linear Regression** to uncover relationships between fuel consumption and emissions.  
✅ **Interactive Visualizations** – Provides **insightful charts** to illustrate data trends and correlations.
