# Fuel Consumption Prediction Model  

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting CO2 emissions based on various fuel consumption factors using a **Multiple Linear Regression** model. The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes data on fuel consumption for different vehicles.

## Features  
- **CO2 Emissions Prediction:** Accurately forecasts CO2 output based on given input variables.  
- **Regression Analysis:** Implements multiple linear regression to uncover relationships between variables.  
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Provides visual representations of data correlations.
